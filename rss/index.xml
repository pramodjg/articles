<p>The healthcare providers in the entire world offers high-end technologies for analysing and determining a particular disease. But there are certain key problems which are need to be rectified in the healthcare industry.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_poor_data_standardisation">Poor data standardisation:</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In today&#8217;s healthcare industry, healthcare data is held in some type of centralised location. It may be an EHR system, a data warehouse, a physical file,or a repository run by a health information exchange. Each of this system may have been independently working and stores information it its own particular format. This makes sharing information among health service providers difficult. Also this will frustrate the patients and providers if they needs to exchange data with some other institution.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Quality and accuracy of data is a key concern in healthcare industry. There are various reasons for this :</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>mistakes from physician or clinician
improper updation of EHR ( Electronic Health Record ) due to simultaneous editing.
different providers holds different versions of same patients record
Security flaws :</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Flaws in privacy and security is a major issue in healthcare industry. Due to the intensely private and secure nature of healthcare data, these are kept in locations where access is theoretically restricted to certain trusted parties. But if somebody gains access, the security of data fails there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Blockchain helps to rectify the above mentioned flaws in healthcare industry.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let us discuss what Blockchain is :</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Blockchain is a data structure which can be used to create a digital
ledger of transactions and share the data amount a distributed network of computers. each participant uses a cryptography to manipulate the ledger in a secure way. We cannot change or remove a block of data once it is recorded on the blockchain ledger.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_application_of_blockchain_in_healthcare_industry">Application of Blockchain in healthcare industry</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Blockchain provides a very fine solution for the key concerns of Healthcare Sector. Let us see how this is possible. Personal Health Records can be stored and administered via Blockchain. These records can be used as digital assets just like currency. For accessing the records, Doctors and other health service providers needed permission from the patient.
As blockchain is decentralised, for nobody will be there to administer the chain. The data, here it is the Health Records , will be shared among all the users. In other words, each of them will have a copy of the record. They are responsible for ensuring integrity and security of the shared information.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">

<a class="image" href="http://wac.1a76d.edgecastcdn.net/801A76D/analytics/images/site/attachments/Blockchain1.png"><img src="https://pramodjg.github.io/articles/images/Blockchain1.png" alt="Blockchain" width="300" height="200"></a>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_blockchain_network">Blockchain Network</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If any of the member wants to change the content of the record, the prime concern for him to gain permission from other members to do so. The modified information need to be approved by other members. Once the modification approved the shared record will be updated, and each member will have a copy of the updated information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These procedure will help the healthcare industry to avoid the major flaws like poor data standardisation and data quality flaw. Also it will free the patient from the task of carrying their records while changing their health consultant or service providers. He just need to add the new consultant/service provider to the chain for sharing his health record. Thus the new consultant/service provider can access the data like the other members of the chain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is recommended that,healthcare organisations would need to limit the number of authorised participants in a single blockchain to a patient, her care team, and her approved family members.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The major difficulty in implementing blockchain in healthcare sector is that nobody quite sure about the implementation, how to deal with current privacy regulations like HIPAA, or which organisation will be prepare to try such a different way of dealing health data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A few early leaders in the healthcare sector are emerging, like Gem, GuardTime, and Factor. They are active in bringing blockchain to the industry. But still the healthcare system is at the very beginning of understanding how such a scheme would work or what it could provide to patients. To finalise blockchain-based infrastructure may take years to mature.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Simply stating, Blockchain is a technology based on distributed computing and cryptography that enables peoples, to transact with previously unknown persons, and record transactions in a ledger. Its a new technology introduced mainly for financial transaction. The unique thing about blockchain is its decentralized nature. Which means that there will not be any trusted third-party for authorizing transactions like banks or financial institutions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a blockchain network, data or transactions are recorded publicly. So it will be available to everybody in the network. Each one in the network will have a copy of the information. If anybody inside the network wants to change the information , the first step is to get approval from the members inside the network. Also for saving the changes made in the information, approval is needed from other members. Once the changes approved, the information belongs to each member will be updated. This is a simple explanation how blockchain works.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although the adoption of blockchain is happening slowly, it is a powerful technology or rather strategy that will disrupt all the existing business sectors in the current world. We hereby discussing a few business sector which will get disrupted by this powerful technology.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Below is a list of some key features of block chain technology</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Security – hacking is impossible given the ledger is distributed across thousands of computers, reducing server maintenance requirements and improving security for banks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Transparency – the sender and recipient of each transactions are recorded and all transactions are publicly available for inspection.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Privacy – users are anonymous and can move money around instantly and securely. This allows banks to save time and reduces costs on international</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Risk – currently, if a bank’s system goes down, users are unable to perform transactions. Using the blockchain technology, the bank’s system would continue as normal.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_banking">Banking</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All the Banking Institutions acts as secure store houses and transfer hubs for value. Blockchain will do the same for it is as a digitized, secure, and tamper-proof ledger.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_payments_and_transactions">Payments and Transactions</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Blockchain connects the payer and payee without any intermediate person to control the transactions. This will make instant money transfer possible.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_academic_sector">Academic Sector</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can make use of Blockchain technology for authorizing certificates. As it required that everybody inside the network need to approve, possibility of fraudulent activities will be reduced. Also it will make the procedure of issuing certificates more transparent.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_voting">Voting</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Authentication of voter’s identity, tracking of votes and trusted tallies to determine the winner, are the basic functions of an election procedure. Here blockchain can act as the medium for casting, tracking and counting votes thereby reducing chances of fowl-play. By casting votes as transactions within the blockchain, voters can agree on the final count because they can count the votes themselves, and because of the blockchain audit trail, they can verify that no votes were changed or removed, and no illegitimate votes were added.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_real_estate">Real Estate</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main concerns for buying and selling property includes</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lack of Transaparency during and after transactions
Large amount of paperwork
Possibility of fraud and errors in public records
Blockchain offers a way to reduce the need for file-based record keeping and thereby speeding up the transactions. it can help record, track, and transfer land titles, property deeds, liens etc.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_healthcare">Healthcare</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Institutions in healthcare sector have an inability to securely share data across platforms. Better collaboration of data between providers ensures higher probability of accurate diagnoses, higher likelihood of effective treatments, and the overall increased ability of healthcare systems to deliver cost-effective care. Blockchain can allow hospitals, payers, and other parties in the healthcare value-chain to share access to their networks without compromising data security and integrity.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_supply_chain_management">Supply Chain Management</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Supply chains are basically a series of transaction nodes that link to move products from point A to the point-of-sale or final deployment. By using blockchain, as products change hands across a supply chain from manufacture to sale, the transactions can be documented in a permanent decentralized record which reduces time delays, added costs, and human errors.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_cloud_storage">Cloud Storage</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cloud storage is a very common feature in data handling. This will secure customers’ data in a centralized server which can mean increased network vulnerability from attacks by hackers. Blockchain cloud storage solutions allow storage to be decentralized, and therefore less prone to attacks that can cause systemic damage and widespread data loss.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_loyalty">Loyalty</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This technology can help retailer for offering gift cards and loyalty programs. It also makes those systems cheaper and secure. For no middle-,men are needed for issuing cards and transactions this method will be more efficient and cost effective. Blockchain’s unique verification capability save costs and help fraudulent activities.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To wrap up , this a very small list of sectors blockchain going to disrupt. The area of application is very big and cannot be explain altogether.</p>
